# Phase 1.2: Target User Validation - Quick Start Guide

**Your Role**: Interviewee (dual perspective: solo dev + team lead)  
**Time Required**: ~90-120 minutes total for both interviews  
**Format**: Structured Q&A (you fill in responses)  
**Output**: User personas and validation report

---

## What You Have

✅ **phase-1-2-internet-research.md** - Background on indie dev community, pain points, AI adoption, and market context

✅ **phase-1-2-interview-framework.md** - Two detailed interview guides (Interview #1 for solo dev, Interview #2 for team lead)

---

## How to Proceed

### Step 1: Review Internet Research (15 minutes)

Read through `phase-1-2-internet-research.md` to:

- Understand the indie developer ecosystem
- See what pain points are commonly reported
- Get context on AI tool adoption patterns
- **Why?** Helps you answer interview questions with personal context

### Step 2: Interview #1 - Solo Developer Perspective (40-50 minutes)

**Use**: `phase-1-2-interview-framework.md` - **Part B**

**Your Task**:

- Answer questions in **Sections B.1 through B.6** (questions 1-14)
- Fill in responses in the `[Space for your response]` blocks
- Be specific and honest; there are no "right" answers
- Spend 3-5 minutes per question; more if you have lots to say

**Key Questions to Focus On** (most important):

- **B.2, Q5**: Biggest friction points in your solo dev workflow
- **B.2, Q6**: How you manage context and maintain continuity
- **B.3, Q8**: How you prepare context for AI (THIS IS KEY TO dev-glow VALUE)
- **B.3, Q9**: What AI assistance would help you MOST
- **B.4, Q10-11**: What "lightweight" and "empowering" mean to you
- **B.6, Q12**: Validation of dev-glow concept

**Expected Output**:

- Clear picture of your solo dev workflow
- Identified pain points
- Current AI usage patterns
- Concept validation score

### Step 3: Interview #2 - Team Lead Perspective (40-50 minutes)

**Use**: `phase-1-2-interview-framework.md` - **Part C**

**Your Task**:

- Answer questions in **Sections C.1 through C.7** (questions 1-16)
- Fill in responses in the `[Space for your response]` blocks
- Think from your team lead perspective (not solo)
- Be specific about your team's current state

**Key Questions to Focus On** (most important):

- **C.2, Q3**: Your team's end-to-end development process
- **C.2, Q5**: Biggest process pain points (where team wastes time)
- **C.2, Q6**: Context and knowledge management challenges
- **C.3, Q7**: What's currently automated vs. what you wish was
- **C.4, Q10**: Which AI capabilities would help your team MOST
- **C.4, Q11**: What context structure would AI need
- **C.6, Q14**: Validation of dev-glow concept for teams

**Expected Output**:

- Clear picture of your team's development process
- Identified bottlenecks and friction
- AI opportunity assessment
- Concept validation score

### Step 4: Send Me Your Responses

Once you've filled in both interviews, share the updated files with me. I will:

1. ✅ Synthesize your responses
2. ✅ Create formal user personas (Solo Dev + Team Lead)
3. ✅ Build workflow maps with annotated pain points
4. ✅ Document unmet needs and feature priorities
5. ✅ Assess tool concept viability
6. ✅ Produce final deliverable: **Phase 1.2 User Research Report**

## Interview Tips

### Before You Start

- Set aside dedicated, uninterrupted time
- Have a quiet space (no distractions)
- Think about your actual workflow (don't overthink "ideal" workflows)
- Be honest about pain points; no need to sugarcoat

### While Answering

- **Be specific**: Examples > generalizations
  - ❌ "I track things badly"
  - ✅ "I use GitHub Issues for some tasks, Notion for others, and sometimes just remember them"
  
- **Be honest about frustrations**: This is most valuable
  - ❌ "Everything is fine"
  - ✅ "Switching between tools kills my flow; I lose 30 min each time switching between VS Code, Linear, and Slack"

- **Provide details**:
  - How long does something take?
  - How often does it happen?
  - Who else is involved?
  - What's the cost of failure?

- **For concept validation** (B.6 Q12 and C.6 Q14):
  - Read the dev-glow concept carefully
  - Compare it against your actual pain points
  - Be realistic about whether you'd actually use it
  - Give honest score (1-10); include reasoning

### After You Finish

- Review your responses (do they make sense?)
- Add any follow-up thoughts in comments
- Share both files (Interview Framework + Internet Research)

## Key Metrics I'll Extract

After you complete interviews, I'll analyze:

1. **Pain Point Validation**
   - How many core pain points do you confirm?
   - How severe are they? (1-10 scale)
   - Target: ≥3 confirmed, ≥7 severity average

2. **Tool Concept Validation**
   - Your score on dev-glow concept (1-10)
   - Target: ≥7/10 from both perspectives
   - Reasoning behind score

3. **Feature Prioritization**
   - Which features would you use first?
   - What's the minimum viable set for V1?

4. **Pricing Acceptance**
   - What would you pay for this tool?
   - Free OSS enough? Or would you pay?

5. **Go/No-Go Signal**
   - Combined with internet research: should we proceed to Phase 2?

---

## Expected Outcomes

### For You

- Clarity on your own workflows
- Validation that your pain points are real (not just you)
- Early input on tool direction

### For dev-glow

- Primary user validation from target persona
- Concept market-fit assessment
- Feature prioritization guidance
- Confidence level to proceed to Phase 2 (Feasibility Research)

## Template Structure (For Reference)

Each interview question follows this pattern:

```markdown
[Question Number]. **Question Title** (Optional importance indicator)
[Question text with context]

**YOUR RESPONSE**:
> [Space for your response]
```

**Your job**: Replace `[Space for your response]` with your actual answer.
