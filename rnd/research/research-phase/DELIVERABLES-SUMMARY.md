## 📊 What Happens Next

### After You Complete Interviews, I Will

1. **Synthesize Findings** (1-2 hours)
   - Extract key insights from your responses
   - Identify pain point themes
   - Document unmet needs

2. **Create User Personas** (1 hour)
   - Solo Developer persona (based on Interview #1)
   - Team Lead persona (based on Interview #2)
   - Workflow maps with annotated pain points

3. **Assess Concept Validation** (30 min)
   - Compile validation scores (1-10 for dev-glow concept)
   - Analyze feature prioritization
   - Document pricing sensitivity

4. **Deliver Phase 1.2 Report** (Final)
   - **"User Research & Validation Report"**
   - Executive summary
   - Detailed findings
   - User personas and workflows
   - Go/No-Go recommendation for Phase 2

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**Interview validation is successful if**:

- [ ] ✅ ≥3 confirmed pain points matching dev-glow's value proposition
- [ ] ✅ Pain point severity averages ≥7/10 (scale of 1-10)
- [ ] ✅ Tool concept scores ≥7/10 from **both** personas (solo + team)
- [ ] ✅ Clear feature prioritization emerges (what matters most for V1?)
- [ ] ✅ Pricing model validated ($0-15/month range shows acceptance)
- [ ] ✅ Both perspectives indicate willingness to try MVP

## 📞 Questions Before You Start?

**Q: Where should I start?**
A: Open `README-PHASE-1-2.md` for overview, then read `PHASE-1-2-START-HERE.md` for step-by-step guidance.

**Q: How much time do the interviews take?**
A: 40-50 min for Interview #1 + 40-50 min for Interview #2 = 90-120 minutes total.

**Q: What if I don't know an answer?**
A: That's fine. Note it. "Not sure" or "Need to think about this" is valid.

**Q: Can I edit my responses later?**
A: Yes, interviews are iterative. You can add/clarify after.

**Q: What's the importance of the "concept validation" score?**
A: Critical. If dev-glow scores <6/10, we need to reconsider the idea or pivot direction.
