### Decomposition & Integration Planning

Code, Infrastructure, Environment, Delivery Decomposition & Integration Planning includes breaking down the high-level design into manageable components, planning their integration, and defining delivery strategies.

To run Delivery Loop it is necessary to have strategy or plan for iterative development, release, and delivery of the product. Each iteration should produce a potentially shippable product increment keepning it consistent and aligned with the overall product vision, goals, and requirements.

Expected Outcomes:

1. Defined requirement sets (as features? traits? capabilities?) to be delivered in first iteraition and subsequent planned iterations (MVP, MMP, ...?).
2. Defined strategy for preparing product increment requirement sets for regular iterations, and requirement dependency and integrity maintenance.
3. Defined strategy for integrating delivered increments into the overall product.

Expected Results:

1. Documented iteration plans and delivery strategies.
2. Documented integration strategies and plans.

Expected Activities:

1. Break down High Level design to requirement mappings to define planned iterations.
2. Define strategy for preparing product increment requirement sets for regular iterations, and requirement dependency and integrity maintenance.
3. Define strategy for integrating delivered increments into the overall product.

### Delivery Loop

Delivery Loop includes iterative cycles of delivering increments of the product to users or customers, gathering feedback, and making necessary adjustments.

Each Cycle may include Development Loop and Release Loop resulting in product increment, Runtime Environment increment, Infrastructure increment and Development Environment increment.

#### Development Loop

Development Loop includes iterative cycles of low level analysis and design, planning, implementing, testing.

##### Low Level Analysis & Design

Expected Outcomes:


#### Planning

#### Implementation

#### Testing

#### Release Loop

Release Loop includes iterative cycles of deployment, regression testing, stabilization, and release.

#### Delivery

Delivery includes delivery and deployment of the product, gathering feedback, support, maintenance, hot-fix delivery.

## Solo-Developer Small-Team Modes Differences

### Solo-Developer Modes

In Self-Employed mode, a solo developer works independently on their own product. They bear all responsibilities, risks, and rewards. The primary challenges revolve around managing all aspects of the project alone, from ideation to deployment.

In Employed mode, a solo developer works within a larger organization or team. They may in some cases have access to employer-provided resources, tools, and support. The primary challenges involve aligning with organizational goals, processes, and collaboration with other team members.

### Small-Team Modes

in Startup mode, a small team (e.g., 2-5 people) works on their own product. They share the vision, risks, and rewards. The primary challenges shift from *doing* the work to *coordinating* the work and maintaining a *shared understanding*.

in Outsourced mode, a small team (e.g., 2-5 people) works on a product for an external client. They must balance the client's requirements, expectations, and communication with their own internal processes and collaboration. The primary challenges involve managing client relationships, scope changes, and delivering value within constraints.
