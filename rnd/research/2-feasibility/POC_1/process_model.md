# Development Process Model

[Common definitions](definitions.md)

- **Product Quality**: Resolved, Contained, Unresolved
- **Product Costs**: Optimal, Expensive, Overwhelming
- **Product Size**: Tiny, Small, Medium, Large

## Use Cases and Scenarios

### Solo Development

#### Solo Work Modes

- Freelance
- Hobby
- Startup MVP
- Research POC

The defining characteristic is that the developer works either independently or for another party. Let us define these work modes:

- Self-employed
- Employed

#### Solo Work Costs Clarification

For a solo developer, work costs primarily consist of personal time and effort invested in the project.

#### Solo Product Quality Clarification

From a solo developer's perspective, product quality is the subjective feeling of satisfaction with the created product, based on personal standards and expectations complemented by external feedback, if any.

#### Solo Scenarios

### Small Team Development

A small group of developers collaborates on the project, sharing responsibilities for design, coding, testing, and deployment.

#### Small Team Work Modes

- Startup
- IT outsourcing
- Team within a larger organization

#### Small Team Work Costs Clarification

For small teams, work costs include not only individuals' time and effort but also coordination overhead, communication efforts, and potential delays due to dependencies among team members. These typically translate to financial costs, as team members are often compensated for their work along with other operational expenses.

#### Small Team Product Quality Clarification

Unlike solo development, instead of one developer's feeling, there might be different approaches to measure quality:

- Team consensus
- Client/community feedback analysis
- Market performance
- Stakeholder reviews

### Open Collaborations

We consider open collaborations as a hybrid approach combining elements of solo and small team development, where individuals or small teams contribute to a larger project, typically in an open-source or community-driven context.

#### Open Collaboration Work Modes

- Open-source
- Community-driven
- Foundation-backed
- Corporate-sponsored

From a project perspective, the work mode defines the governance and sustainability model:

- Community-governed: Project decisions made by contributor consensus or a maintainer group.
- Foundation-backed: Project hosted under a foundation with formal governance.
- Corporate-sponsored: Project primarily driven by one or more companies.
- Hybrid: A combination of the above.

#### Open Collaboration Work Costs Clarification

Work costs in open collaborations are distributed among contributors, with varying levels of investment depending on their role and commitment.

#### Open Collaboration Product Quality Clarification

Quality from the project's perspective is measured by its health and sustainability:

- Community activity level and growth.
- Responsiveness to issues and contributions.
- Release consistency and maintenance cadence.
- Documentation completeness and currency.
- Test coverage and CI/CD maturity.

## Problem Introduction

In the context of software development processes, several limiting factors can reduce process effectiveness and product quality:

1. **Drifting or deviation from initial goals, values, and vision**, caused by:
    - Lack of clarity or understanding of goals, vision, or initial requirements among team members.
        - Poor communication or documentation of initial goals and requirements.
        - Misalignment of goals and vision with requirements.
    - Changing requirements or priorities over time.
        - Following trends or external pressures without critical evaluation and reconciliation with initial goals.
        - Scope creep due to a lack of disciplined change management.
    - Lack of tracking and measuring progress and alignment with initial goals and requirements.
        - Insufficient feedback loops to validate ongoing work against initial goals and requirements.
    - Poor semantic connections between analysis, design, task breakdown, specification, implementation, testing, and validation phases.
        - Treating phases as isolated silos rather than interconnected components of a unified process.
        - Lack of referencing and reasoning in information artifacts to maintain context and traceability.
    - Inadequate retrospectives or reviews to identify and address deviations from initial goals.

2. **Skill gaps or behavioral issues among team members**, caused by:
    - Lack of a considerable, clear, informative, and simple (not overcomplicated) policy or guiding process to follow.
    - Lack of training or mentoring to develop and maintain necessary skills and mindset.
    - Lack of a clear and considerable mechanism to enforce adherence to process and standards.
    - Lack of accountability and ownership for quality and outcomes.
    - Poor team dynamics and collaboration practices, communication breakdowns, conflicts, and low trust.

3. **Pressure related to deadlines, budget, and resources**, caused by:
    - Lack of planning and estimation capabilities.
        - Lack of reliable support (such as data, experience, or expertise).
    - Incorrect planning control model.
        - Unnecessary restrictions and requirements.
        - Unluckily chosen planning approach.
    - Ignorance of efforts and tasks important for estimation, risk management, and quality assurance.

4. **Poor quality assurance practices**, caused by:
    - Lack of clear quality standards and criteria.
    - Insufficient testing and validation coverage.
    - Lack of automated testing and continuous integration.
    - Poor defect tracking and resolution processes.
    - Inadequate code reviews and peer feedback mechanisms.
