# Product

This directory contains the code and related files for POC_1 of the Dev-Glow project.

## Structure

- `product/POC_1/glow-core/` - Core library implementing the main functionalities of the Dev-Glow toolset.
- `product/POC_1/glow-mcp/` - MCP (Microservice Control Plane) server implementation for Dev-Glow.
- `glow-cli/` - Command Line Interface for interacting with the Dev-Glow toolset.
- `rnd/design/POC_1/` - Design files related to POC_1.
- `rnd/research/2-feasibility/POC_1/` - Research files related to the feasibility study for POC_1.

## Purpose

To prove the concept of a toolset.

## Code Policy

For POC implementations, focus on rapid development and proof of concept rather than strict adherence to production-level code quality and clarity policies.

However, maintain a reasonable level of code organization and documentation to facilitate future refactoring and development.

API test scenarios should cover the main functionalities to ensure the POC meets its objectives, and ideally reflect POC valuation scenarios.
